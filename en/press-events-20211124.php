						<div class="tc"><img src="../images/press_news/press-room-new-pic-20211124-cyclo-pal.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></div>
						<p>The Cyclo Discover product line is oriented towards "leisure travel" and considers the needs of middle-aged and senior cyclists. Recognizing potential physiological and psychological demands, the Cyclo Discover Pal has an intuitive graphical user interface design, large font and button size, and high color contrast.</p>
						<p>The device is waterproof and resistant to sweat, mud, and rain. In addition, some countries, such as the Netherlands and Spain, prohibit cyclists from using mobile phones while riding; this product provides call and message notifications for added convenience and safety.</p>
						<p>With the newly developed MioShare app, together with cloud OTA updates, users can search for nearby routes by region, month, distance, and time of ride, and download them to Cyclo devices. The WeJoin group ride feature allows Cyclo Discover Pal users to easily invite friends and family to ride the same route through the app, regardless of whether they own a Cyclo device or not.</p>
