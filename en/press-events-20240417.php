							<p>(Taipei, Taiwan, April 17, 2024) â€“ MiTAC Digital Technology Corp. (MDT), a company with extensive experience in the automotive electronics industry, showcased a series of products and solutions at AutoTronics Taipei 2024 (April 17th-20th). For consumers, MDT introduced 4K high-resolution dashcam and its dedicated apps, while for fleet management, advanced video telematics solutions and next-generation in-vehicle tablet devices were unveiled. Additionally, MDT expanded our reach into the smart retail industries with the introduction of a 27-inch self-service kiosk equipped with dual systems and showcased our latest embedded and Edge AI systems for Intelligent AI Applications.</p>
							<p  class="mt_4"><span class="b">4K High-resolution dashcam with software services:</span> MDT is consistently introducing dashcams that offer high-definition recording quality at 4K resolution. The new MiVue E80 rear camera features Sony's STARVISTM 2 Lowlight sensor, effectively enhancing sensitivity to near-infrared light, and capturing footage in low-light environments with up to four times more brightness compared to conventional sensors. In addition, through 4G LTE connectivity and a dedicated mobile app, MDT has entered the realm of dash cam software services by introducing our connected dashcams. It enables real-time remote monitoring of parked vehicles. Additionally, utilizing AI technology, image processing, and recognition functionalities, MDT has introduced driver behavior monitoring features. Users can analyze driving safety indices via the mobile app and potentially utilize them for estimating insurance premiums in the future.</p>
							<p  class="mt_4"><span class="b">Advanced video telematics solutions (MioEYE K series + VisionMax):</span> Continuously honored with the Taiwan Excellence Award for three consecutive years, MDT presents the most comprehensive 360-degree AI video telematics management solution <span class="b">(VisionMax)</span> with support for up to seven cameras. This solution not only records and detects blind spots or rear views of large vehicles in real-time but also issues warnings to drivers through the MioEYE K Series cameras in anticipation of potential accidents. Complemented by the self-developed driver behavior safety management solution (RouteSafety Coach), map data is integrated into fleet management solutions, enhancing their comprehensiveness and integrity. RouteSafety Coach utilizes real-time imagery combined with AI-powered image analysis to conduct driver behavior analysis for fleet management. Fleet management personnel can easily access and analyze driver behavior data collected by RouteSafety Coach through the backend, enabling more accurate predictions of future accident risks.</p>
							<p  class="mt_4"><span class="b">New 8-inch fleet tablet - MioWORK F840:</span> Following the design for fleet management scenarios, the new F840 is equipped with the Android 13 and a next-generation Qualcomm processor, delivering an 80% performance boost.
