					<p>
						The MioWORK<sup>&trade;</sup> A500 series represents the optimal fusion of comfort and ruggedness creating a perfect solution for a wide range of commercial applications. Similar in design to a smartphone, the A500 Series houses a five-inch capacitive multi-touch panel with glove support, providing ease-of-use without sacrificing ruggedness, endurance, or durability. It is suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications in Logistics and Transportation, Field Service, Retail Customer Service, Inventory Management, and Pharmacy Management.
					</p>
					<p>
						The A500 series features high-sensitivity, industrial-grade GPS and GLONASS technology from Qualcomm<sup>&reg;</sup>, ensuring location precision and effortless tracking of vehicles and inventory while increasing effectiveness and efficiency in the supply chain. The device is suitable for use both indoor and outdoor use with its IP67 casing capable of withstanding drops of up to 1.8m. Additionally, the MioCARE<sup>&trade;</sup> A500 further features a special antimicrobial housing and can be disinfected with most common healthcare cleaning products - ensuring compliance with healthcare industry infection control standards.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						The world-class, lightning-fast Zebra<sup>&reg;</sup> SE4750 1D/2D barcode imager with PRZM Intelligent imaging technology overcomes even damaged, creased or curved barcodes. The standard LED imager has a scanning range of up to 110cm, ideal for applications in retail and healthcare including patient identification, drug identification and medication management. The A500 is also available with an extended-range Laser imager capable of a scanning range up to 6m. This best-in-class imager offers exemplary scanning performance for applications including warehousing and inventory management. Additionally, the device supports NFC for connection with card readers and two-factor authentication, as well as HF RFID for effortless asset tracking.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						The optional “Pistol Grip” accessory also includes a unique ‘enter’ key, which maximizes efficiency with a one-handed scan-and-enter technique, making the customary use of the touchscreen redundant during this process. This enables the input of essential barcode information for streamlined and rapid stock-control solutions.

						【The F700 Series】
					</p>
					<p class="b">
						Exclusively Designed with Vehicle Telematics and 4G/LTE Connection for In-Vehicle Use
					</p>
					<p>
						Protected by an IP54-rated housing and MIL-STD-810Gdrop resistance up to 1.8m with protective caps, the MioWORK F700 meets the strict SAE J1455 industry standard for heavy duty vehicle applications. It is vibration and shock resistant up to 20G peaks and withstands extreme temperatures ranging from -20 to 60 degrees Celsius. For all its ruggedness, the F700 weighs only 485g and can be comfortably held in one hand during field work with and without the optional hand strap accessory.
					</p>
					<p>
						The F700 features highly sensitivity GPS and GLONASS technology from Qualcomm<sup>&reg;</sup>, assuring the location precision of your fleet. This combined with the F700’s integrated standard NFC/HF RFID capability creates the ideal platform to ensure effortless tracking of vehicles and assets on the road. When used outside a vehicle during vehicle inspection or maintenance work, an 8MP rear camera allows for efficient data capture. The F700 also integrates 4G technology, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.1 BLE, making it the ultimate solution for your fleet and field service needs.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						The F740 is supported by a dedicated active vehicle cradle for reliable mounting and optimal peripheral connectivity. A dedicated fleet cable port offers a reliable alternative to Bluetooth ODB connection for monitoring and reporting of vehicle metrics and driver behavior. Micro-USB charging is swapped for a pogo-pin connection for ease-of-use and increased durability, while the easy-release button and magnet guidance allow for effortless tablet removal for out-of-vehicle use.&nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
						Ideally sized for in-vehicle use, the 7-inch touchscreen comfortably shows workflows and fleet navigation without obstructing the driver’s view. The screen houses a 630-nits high brightness panel with optical bonding technology, and its 85° view angle ensures high visibility throughout the vehicle — even in bright daylight situations. The screen can even be used while wearing gloves, such as in adverse weather conditions when performing mandatory vehicle inspections.&nbsp;
