							<p>(Taipei, Taiwan, May 24th, 2022) A trusted leader in automotive electronics and the AIoT industry, MiTAC Digital Technology Corporation (MDT) announced today it was named winner of the 2022 Computex Best Choice Award. MDT’s video telematics and management solution (the MioEYE K series and VisionMax platform) was recognized in the "IoT Applications" category.</p>
							<p>Centering on the sense of driving safety and data security, MDT's video telematics and management solution helps customers improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the operations. It integrates camera IQ tuning technology, big data, AI driver behavior analysis, ADAS, and IoT services to provide a private dash cam network and fleet management platform protected by advanced data security technology.</p>
							<p>With years of experience in digital driver recorder product and technology, the duo-channel MioEYE K series records high resolution video clips even in vivid contrast environments. Edge AI-enabled cameras (both front and inner) offer ADAS functionality and DMS, allowing customers to monitor lane departure, forward collision, distracted driving in real-time, issue real-time incident alerts, and perform preventative driver coaching. These features can be used by customers to prevent potential accidents and lower costs.</p>
							<p>Moreover, once an accident occurs, the video clip is not only saved on the camera internal flash and SD card, the backup file is also uploaded to the VisionMax management platform through 4G LTE connectivity, customers can access the backend platform to retrieve files at any time. The event reconstriction design help customers clarify the cause or responsible party of an accident. For customers’ benefit, selected models of the MioEYE K series not only support dual SD slots, up to four external cameras can be connected to provide footage and driving statistics based on full 360-degree coverage.</p>
							<p>Furthermore, to secure the fleet’s telematics statistics, the VisionMax platform was designed and developed under GDPR and DSLA guidelines to ensure data integrity, video storage safety and anti-hacking mechanisms.</p>
